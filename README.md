# Building my own database
An attempt to learn how databases work by building a simple database

Will be documenting my journey of learning & building a simple database from scratch using C.
In short, learning how does a database **work**?

I am buiding a clone of [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/arch.html) from scratch in C in order to understand, and I am going to document my process as I go.
